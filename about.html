              I wanted to follow my knack for User Experience and learn how to
              code so I could gain knowledge around building solutions for my
              ideas.

                >SheCodes</a
              >
              is an excellent program. The workshops took me from knowing
              nothing about coding or even where to begin, to seeing my code
              come to life and being confident in what I have learned. Concepts
              were fully explained and tech staff was helpful and explained
              roadblocks to assist with challenges and homework when needed. I
              was challenged with real-life exercises and achieve well deserved
              certifications. Thank you

            Hello, and welcome! My name is Tammy Knight, and I'm an User
            Experience oriented developer with an interest in humane
            development. I have always been an ideas person, and learning the
            skills to make them come to life is rewarding and fulfilling. I have
            a passion for User Accepted Testing, and coding allows me further
            knowledge for what is possible to make the User Experience, not just
            good, but great.
            <br />
            <br />
            Beyond programming, my interests include music, painting,
            literature, martial arts, fitness, walking/hiking, travel, playing
            board games, film & television, spending time with friends & family,
            learning, self-development and of couse, my loving puppers, Lexi!

            Professionally, throughout my tenure with Verizon, I managed
            multiple projects and always strived to develop processes and
            suggestions to better my team and users of our systems. I partnered
            with other IT departments on a regular basis to design and structure
            changes that were needed.
            <br />
            <br />
            As an End User Support Executive Admin, I was taksed with managing
            the testing of our department's projects and deployments due to my
            capabilities and passion for User Accepted Testing. During our
            transition to Concur for Travel and Expense, I was placed on the
            testing team last minute. I was recognized for giving more testing
            results and feedback in just one week than anyone put together the
            entire pilot, and for finds that saved Verizon a considerable amount
            of capital.
